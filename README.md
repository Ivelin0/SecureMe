# SecureMe - Smart Device Protection System
 
![SecureMe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1e49d66-0f4c-4dcd-9a05-46bcd62e12cf)

A comprehensive multi-platform security solution that provides additional physical-level protection for smart devices across Android, Linux, and Windows platforms.
 
## üõ°Ô∏è Overview
 
SecureMe is an integrated security system designed to protect smart devices from various threats through real-time monitoring, automated notifications, and comprehensive analysis tools. The system consists of a "smart" client installed on the specific device, a central server for data processing, and a web dashboard for management and monitoring.
The word "smart" comes from the fact that it can be shared and connected across all type of devices and operating systems through an account.

## üèÜ Main cause

SecureMe is an award-winning cybersecurity project that achieved recognition at multiple international Bulgarian olympiads in 2024. The project was developed to address the growing need for comprehensive, cross-platform security solutions in an increasingly connected world.
Current Status: While not being mantained ever since it had followed a successful competition phase. The codebase represents a fully functional security solution that demonstrates advanced concepts in multi-platform security architecture.
